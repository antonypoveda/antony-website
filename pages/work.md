## Government Digital Service (GDS), 2025 to now
Designing frameworks, standards and guidance for teams building public services. My main focus is the content design of the Government Digital and Data Profession Capability Framework.

As an example, here's a write up of work I led to [update the skill descriptions for user-centered design roles](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2024/12/03/updating-design-skills-in-the-government-digital-and-data-capability-framework/).

## Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO), 2023 to 2025
